Math-BigInt-FastCalc

Math::BigInt::FastCalc is a replacement library for Math::BigInt::Calc that
reimplements some of the Math::BigInt::Calc functions in XS. It can be used
via:

    use Math::BigInt lib => 'FastCalc';

This is always safe to use, since:

  * FastCalc is always faster than Calc, or equal in speed. It will be never
    slower.
  * If FastCalc is not installed, Math::BigInt will automatically use Calc.

Of course, it also works with Math::BigFloat

	use Math::BigFloat lib => 'FastCalc';

or even Math::BigRat:

	use Math::BigRat lib => 'FastCalc';

Please have fun!
